Hi, I am Yogesh Mandge, a Graduate student and Research Assistant in Computer Science at the [Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad (IITH)](https://www.iith.ac.in/).

I am advised by [Prof. Antony Franklin](https://iith.ac.in/~antony/), and a member of the [Networked Wireless Systems (NeWS)](https://newslab.iith.ac.in/) group. My research focuses on the application of high-frequency wireless on-chip communication in large-scale multicore architectures with hundreds or even thousands of cores. Specifically, my goal is to design scalable and efficient memory hierarchies that reduce the large cost of core-to-core communication in parallel computing. <br clear="left" />

Prior to joining IIT Hyderabad I obtained my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science and Engineering from the [Shri Ram Institute of Science and Technology (SRIST)](http://sritgroup.net/), India.

Although I have lived in a few different places over the last years, I grew up in [Jabalpur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jabalpur), India&mdash;a beautiful little city in [Madhya Pradesh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madhya_Pradesh) where I still often go to visit my family and friends.

Besides Computer Science related topics, my other personal interests and hobbies include drawing/sketching, playing chess, running/hiking, travelling, and photography.

You can find a copy of my full resume [here](docs/resume_long_antonio_franques.pdf). Also, you can email me at either [yog3shmandg3@gmail.com](mailto:yog3shmandg3@gmail.com) (personal) or [cs18mtech11031@iith.ac.in](mailto:cs18mtech11031@iith.ac.in) (academic).
