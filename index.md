Hi, I am Yogesh Mandge, a Graduate student in Computer Science at the [Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad (IITH)](https://www.iith.ac.in/).

I am advised by [Prof. Antony Franklin](https://iith.ac.in/~antony/), and a member of the [Networked Wireless Systems (NeWS)](https://newslab.iith.ac.in/) group. My research focuses on the application of high-frequency wireless on-chip communication in large-scale multicore architectures with hundreds or even thousands of cores. Specifically, my goal is to design scalable and efficient memory hierarchies that reduce the large cost of core-to-core communication in parallel computing. <br clear="left" />

In Fall 2018 and Spring 2019, I interned at AMD Research, developing and benchmarking driver and library software to evaluate the capabilities and performance of prototype hardware for exascale computing.

Prior to joining IIT Hyderabad I obtained my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science and Engineering from the [Shri Ram Institute of Science and Technology (SRIST)](http://sritgroup.net/), India. During my undergraduate studies I also performed two years of research in the area of Computational Mathematics under the supervision of Professors [Juan Ramon Torregrosa](https://damres.webs.upv.es/?page_id=946) and [Alicia Cordero](https://damres.webs.upv.es/?page_id=944), as a member of the [DAMRES](https://damres.webs.upv.es/?lang=en) group. 

Although I have lived in a few different places over the last years, I grew up in [Jabalpur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jabalpur), India&mdash;a beautiful little city in [Madhya Pradesh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madhya_Pradesh) where I still often go to visit my family and friends.

Besides Computer Science related topics, my other personal interests and hobbies include running/hiking, rock climbing, travelling, and cooking/nutrition.

You can find a copy of my full resume [here](docs/resume_long_antonio_franques.pdf). Also, you can email me at either [yog3shmandg3@gmail.com](mailto:yog3shmandg3@gmail.com) (personal) or [cs18mtech11031@iith.ac.in](mailto:cs18mtech11031@iith.ac.in) (academic).
